# Distinct Lines

#
#
#Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 â&permil;¤ a,b,c â&permil;¤ N.
#
#
#From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.
#Let D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.
#
#
#You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.
#
#Find D(10^10). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
