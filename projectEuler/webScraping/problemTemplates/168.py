# Number Rotations

#
#Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.
#It can be verified that 714285=5Ă&mdash;142857.
#This demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.
#Find the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 &lt; n &lt; 10^100, that have this property.
