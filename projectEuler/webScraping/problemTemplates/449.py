# Chocolate covered candy

#
#Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: b^2x2 + b2y2 + a2z2 = a2b2.
#
#
#Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.
#<table class="formula"><tr><td>If a=1 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is 
#    </td>
#<td><table class="frac"><tr><td>28</td></tr><tr><td class="overline">3</td></tr></table></td>
#<td>ÄŽ&euro; mm3</td>
#</tr></table>
#If a=2 mm and b=1 mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm3.
#
#
#Find the amount of chocolate in mm3 required if a=3 mm and b=1 mm. Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.
