# Sum of a square and a cube

#
#Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.
#Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.
#For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:
#2285^2 + 203
#2223^2 + 663
#1810^2 + 1253
#1197^2 + 1563
#Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
