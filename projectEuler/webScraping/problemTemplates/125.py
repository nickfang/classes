# Palindromic sums

#
#The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 + 112 + 122.
#There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 0^2 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.
#Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
