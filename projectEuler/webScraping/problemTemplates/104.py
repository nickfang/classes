# Pandigital Fibonacci ends

#
#The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
#<blockquote>Fn = Fnâ&circ;&rsquo;1 + Fnâ&circ;&rsquo;2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.</blockquote>
#It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
#Given that Fk is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
