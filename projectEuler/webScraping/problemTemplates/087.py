# Prime power triples

#
#The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:
#28 = 2^2 + 23 + 24
#33 = 3^2 + 23 + 24
#49 = 5^2 + 23 + 24
#47 = 2^2 + 33 + 24
#How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?
