# Digit fifth powers

#
#Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:
#<blockquote>1634 = 1^4 + 64 + 34 + 44
#8208 = 8^4 + 24 + 04 + 84
#9474 = 9^4 + 44 + 74 + 44</blockquote>
#As 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.
#The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
#Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
