# The incenter of a triangle

#
#
#ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.
#The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. 
#
#
#Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|. 
#
#
#Let S(P) = â&circ;&lsquo;L for all such triangles where p â&permil;¤ P. For example, S(103) = 3619.
#
#
#Find S(107).
